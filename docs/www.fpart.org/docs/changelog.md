# Next: 1.7.1
```nohighlight
    2025/??/??, 1.7.1 ('???') :
    - fpart: update embedded fts(3) using FreeBSD 15-CURRENT's version
    - fpsync: give more time for .ret file to be created
      (see GH discussion #68)
    - fpsync: be more explicit when witness file creation fails
      (see GH issue #70)
    - fpsync: add option -V to print version
      (see GH issue #78)
    - fpsync: add option -Z to prefix logs with human-readable dates instead of
      timestamps (see GH issue #79)
    - fpsync: pretty-print sizes in a human-readable form
```
# Current: 1.7.0
```nohighlight
    2025/01/25, 1.7.0 ('About skiing and high school') :
    - fpsync: check for common commands/tools presence
      (discussed in GH issue #47)
    - fpsync: add support for pax copy tool (option -m)
      Note for packagers: adds a new dependency to pax(1)
      On FreeBSD, depends on the following fix: https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=681fd2bed8eaba88693867ba928a1c03a5b152cc
    - fpsync: rework return code handling and status report
      Use jobs' return codes to compute final status. Before that change,
      fpsync returned an error when a message was printed to stderr by a job.
      It now returns an error when at least one job did not return 0 and prints
      additional information regarding jobs that did return 0 but wrote
      something to stderr (fixes GH issue #61)
    - fpsync: fix failure detection for piped tools (tar, cpio, pax)
    - fpsync: rename main log file to fpsync.log
    - fpsync: improve startup logs
    - fpsync: cleanup log files when replaying a run
    - fpsync: fix wrong jobs rescheduled when resuming a run (option -r)
      That change introduces a new layout within fpsync's temporary directory.
      That version of fpsync will not be able to resume or replay runs
      generated with a previous version.
    - fpsync: fix wrong counters erroneously including killed jobs
    - fpsync: only display kill messages once when pressing CTRL-C
    - fpsync: colorize output
    - fpsync: display additional info when listing runs (-l) in verbose mode
```
# 1.6.0
```nohighlight
    2024/01/21, 1.6.0 ('College years') :
    - fpsync: fix run resuming caused by empty OPT_TOOL_PATH in info file
      (GH PR #44)
    - fpart: add option -P (add parent directories when closing intermediate
      partitions). Useful for fixing directory dates when parallelizing cpio(1)
      or tar(1) jobs
    - fpsync: enable fpart's option -P for 'cpio' and 'tar' tools. This finally
      enables keeping directory modification times intact when parallelizing
      cpio(1) and tar(1) jobs!
    - fpart: fix 2 errors detected by Coverity Scan, see:
      https://scan.coverity.com/projects/fpart
    - fpart: provide long options (for the most important ones)
    - fpsync: fix off-by-n error when calculating ETA in SIGINFO handler
      (fixes GH issue #48)
    - fpsync: show transmitted files count / data size in final status
      and SIGINFO handler (fixes GH issue #24)
    - fpart: final summary now shows total number of parts created, as well as
      total number of files packed and total resulting size
    - fpart: add new hook variables: FPART_TOTALSIZE, FPART_TOTALNUMFILES and
      FPART_TOTALNUMPARTS
    - fpart: add post-run hook (option -R), triggered just before program exits
    - fpsync: Limit useless log generation by removing empty log files
      (see: https://sourceforge.net/p/fpart/discussion/general/thread/5d001d74b6/)
    - fpsync: Facilitate tar tool change on Solaris-based OS
```
# 1.5.1
```nohighlight
    2022/06/22, 1.5.1 ('Feel the light') :
    - fpsync: add source, destination and total elapsed time to the email
      report (GH PR #41)
    - fpsync: add option -T to specify absolute path of copy tool (GH PR #42)
    - fpsync: output cleanups
```
# 1.5.0
```nohighlight
    2022/06/02, 1.5.0 ('Rebirth') :
    - added 'make_release.sh' script to automate release tarball creation
    - embedded fts: check errors from readdir() (GH issue #37)
    - fpart: re-enable large files support on GNU/Linux
      (fixes Debian bug #834328)
    - fpart: start numbering partitions from '1' instead of '0'.
      Special partition '0' is now exclusively reserved for files that do not
      fit in regular partitions when option '-s' *and* non-live mode are used.
      Note for 3rd-party tools: that change may impact you!
      (partly fixes GH issue #36)
    - fpart: avoid returning an additional -empty- partition '1' when only
      special partition '0' has been used
    - fpart: avoid returning special partition '0' when it is empty
      (partly fixes GH issue #36)
    - fpart: add option -S to skip, in live mode, files that are bigger than
      maximum partition size (see man page for more details, fixes GH issue #36)
    - fpart: add FPART_PARTERRNO hook variable that contains 0 if every single
      partition's entry has been fts_read() without error, else last erroneous
      entry's errno (GH issue #37)
    - fpart: add option -Z, used to isolate a failing directory alone within a
      partition (GH issue #37)
    - fpart: change display format when listing files to stdout:
        "partition_index (file_size): file_path"
      becomes:
        "partition_index<tab>file_size<tab>file_path"
      (GH issue #38)
    - fpsync: add more checks for incompatible rsync options
    - fpsync: force non-recursive rsync(1) in file-based mode
    - fpsync: add aggressive mode option (-EE) to enable recursive
      synchronization for erroneous directories (GH issue #37)
    - fpsync: start all idle workers before refresh (GH PR #40)
    - fpsync: rework child processes and SIGINT handling and fix missing display
      of last jobs' completion status (inspired by GH PR #40)
```
# 1.4.0
```nohighlight
    2021/09/24, 1.4.0 ('Joining together') :
    - fpsync: allow special characters and white spaces within fpart options
      Allows something like: fpsync ... -O "-y|foo bar|-y|*.txt" /src/ /dst/
      (fixes GH issue #33)
    - fpsync: fix useless double call to sudo(1) in cpio(1) jobs
    - fpsync: add support for 'tar' and 'tarify' tools
```
# 1.3.0
```nohighlight
    2021/05/08, 1.3.0 ('Cleaning room') :
    - fpart: align get_size() and init_file_entries() behaviour and take
      exclusions into account when computing a directory size.
    - fpart: fix directory size computation when using options -y/-Y.
      Before that change, -D and -E would have returned a size of 0 for a
      directory included through options -y/-Y.
    - fpart: fix detection of an unknown option
    - fpart: various fixes on Darwin
    - fpsync: mask broken pipe errors when dequeueing jobs (fixes GH issue #22)
    - fpsync: fix bug where a job could remain resumable forever under certain
      conditions.
    - fpsync: fix detection of fpart exiting with errors
    - fpsync: add prepare run option (-p)
    - fpsync: add list runs options (-l)
    - fpsync: add replay run option (-R)
    - fpsync: add archive run option (-a)
      Note for packagers: adds a new dependency to tar(1)
    - fpsync: add delete run option (-D)
    - fpsync: rework help and man page for clarification
    - fpsync: add check for incompatible rsync option (--delete)
    - fpsync: add send mail option (-M)
      Note for packagers: adds a new dependency to mail(1)
```
# 1.2.0
```nohighlight
    2020/01/10, 1.2.0 ('Joking') :
    - fpsync: ability to set an unlimited number of files or an unlimited size
      per sync job (fixes GH issue #9)
    - fpart: exclude files earlier (fixes GH issue #14)
      Before that change, excluded files would not make a directory empty and
      still account for its size; excluded files are now considered absent.
      That change does not apply when a directory size is computed after
      a certain depth (option -d) has been reached (in that case, once the
      maximum depth has been reached, every single file accounts for a directory
      size).
    - fpart: allow to specify paths with options '-y', '-Y', '-x' and '-X'
      (fixes GH issue #17)
    - fpart: raise limits for different internal types: the size of a file or
      partition, the number of files inside a partition and the number of
      partitions. That will make fpart(1) ready to handle bigger filesystems.
    - fpart: accept human-friendly size formats for options -s, -p, -q and -r
    - fpsync: accept human-friendly size formats for option -s
    - fpsync: use 'command' instead of 'which' to find binaries
      (fixes GH issue #20)
```
# 1.1.0
```nohighlight
    2018/11/15, 1.1.0 ('Reading') :
    - fpart: options -D and -E now pack files if they are explicitly passed as
      arguments
    - fpsync: simplify and fix detection of remote URLs (fixes GH issue #2)
    - fpsync: implement simple ETA when displaying status
    - fts.h: portability fix for Solaris 10 and earlier (GH PR #4)
    - fpart: fix build on Alpine Linux (GH PR #5)
    - fpsync: add timestamps and part numbers to logs
    - fpsync: add support for cpio copy tool (option -m)
    - fpart: option -Z becomes option -zz (incremental -z)
    - fpart: add option -zzz to add all directories to file lists (as empty)
    - other: lower required autoconf version to 2.63 (GH issue #7)
    - other: update RPM .spec file for CentOS and Feroda (GH issue #7)
```
# 1.0.0
```nohighlight
    2017/11/10, 1.0.0 ('Dancing'):
    - fpart: update embedded fts(3) using FreeBSD 12-CURRENT's version
    - fpart: add option -E to pack directories instead of files
    - fpsync: add option -E to work with directories (enables rsync(1)'s --delete)
      That option finally enables fpsync(1) to parallelize the so-called final
      rsync(1) pass, needed to remove extra files with the --delete option!
      (of course it can also be used on a regular basis instead of the usual
      'file' mode: you will get a perfect mirror without needing any extra
      --delete pass)
    - fpart: add option -0 to end filenames with a null (\0) character when
      using option -o
    - fpsync: use fpart's new option -0 in conjunction with rsync's --from0 option
      to avoid failing on filenames with special characters
    - fpsync: improve documentation
```
# 0.9.3
```nohighlight
    2017/04/27, 0.9.3 ('Funny words'):
    - fpsync: add support for rsync URL as target
      Suggested and tested by Harry Mangalam. Thanks, Harry!
