# About

Fpart is a **F**ilesystem **part**itioner. It helps you sort file trees and
pack them into bags (called "partitions"). It is developed in C and available
under the BSD license.

# Key features

## Fpart

* Blazing fast crawling!
* Generates partitions on a number/file number/size basis
* Provides a live mode with hooks to act immediately on generated file lists
* Supports generating partitions from arbitrary input (e.g. du's output)

## Fpsync

* Parallelizes rsync(1), cpio(1) or tar(1) jobs using fpart(1)
* Supports using a SSH cluster for efficient/distributed data migration
* Starts transfers while FS crawling still goes on
* Supports remote target URLs when using rsync(1)
* Parallelizes your final rsync(1) (--delete) pass too!
* Provides transfer runs' status/resume/replay
* Nearly no dependencies (mostly shell and common tools)
* Lower memory footprint (than raw tools)

# Installing from a package

Packages are already available for many operating systems :

* [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/fpart)
* [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/fpart)
* [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=fpart)
* [CentOS/Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fpart)
* [NixOS](https://search.nixos.org/packages?query=fpart)

# Installing from source

If a pre-compiled package is not available for your favourite operating system,
installing from sources is simple. First, get the source files :

    $ git clone https://github.com/martymac/fpart.git
    $ cd fpart

Then, if there is no 'configure' script in
the main directory, run :

    $ autoreconf -i

(autoreconf comes from the GNU autotools), then run :

    $ ./configure
    $ make

to configure and build fpart.

Finally, install fpart (as root) :

    # make install
